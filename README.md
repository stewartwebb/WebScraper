# NHS Choices Scraper
You can use this PHP script to scrape [NHS Choices](http://www.nhs.uk/) for Pharmacy opening times, review scores and the time this information was last updated.

Provide the script with an HSCIC dispensary list labeled edispensary.csv so that it can search for pharmacies with their F/NHS Code. These are available at [HSCIC](http://systems.hscic.gov.uk/data/ods/datadownloads/gppractice).

Will try to give you a helpful message if the pharmacy page you are looking for does not exist e.g. NHS Choices does not have a pharmacy of that F Code, The organisation has made their profile private.
